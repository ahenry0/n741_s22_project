## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Begin
```{r aha_survey_2010-2022}

load(file = "aha_smpl2.RData")

str(aha_smpl2)

table(aha_smpl2$cntrl, useNA = "ifany")
```
```{r scatter}

ggplot(data = aha_smpl2, aes(x = ftaprn, y = tecar,
color = phygp) "[or facet_wrap( ~ phygp) at end]") +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = lm) +
xlab("Full time employed APRNs") + ylab("Total employed primary care physicians") +
ggtitle("Association between APRNs & PCPhs at hospitals")
```

```{r time trend}
geom_dotplot(aha_smpl2, mapping = aes(x = year, y = ftaprn))
```
